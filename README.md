The Unofficial Speedtest CLI
============================

**** Originally by zpeters, modified by iamacarpet for use as a library ****

The Unofficial Speedtest CLI is a command-line program to test
bandwidth in situations where you don't have access to a full GUI
environment and web browser.

In [2013 I was feeling guilty](http://thehelpfulhacker.net/2013/07/29/giving-something-back/)
about using Open Source software for most of my life without giving
anything back in return.  I decided to create this project to my part
to help the IT community.

A lot of the initial algorithms here are based on different scripts I
found when I was studying how speedtest.net works.  Mainly, @sivel's
[speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli),
thanks for your work!

Why don't my speeds match those reported from the speedtest.net website?
========================================================================
The calculation that is used for testing download speeds is literally measuring the amount of data we are downloading (we request a "random" image and count how many bytes are received) and how long it takes to download.  We multiply by the correct factors to get from bytes to megabits. I consider this to be an honest and accurate measurement.

In speedtest.net's reference documentation they describe doing a lot of manipulation to the results to return an "ideal" measurement (https://support.speedtest.net/entries/20862782-How-does-the-test-itself-work-How-is-the-result-calculated-). This, to me, is trading accuracy for speed and not what I'm looking for out of a testing tool.

For confirmation that my download calculations are correct I have tested against a few other speed testing sites, specifically http://testmy.net ("What makes TestMy.net better") who appear to use an "unfiltered" method of calculating bandwidth speeds.  These results typically match up with speedtest.net cli
